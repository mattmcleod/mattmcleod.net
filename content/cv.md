## Overview

I have over 25 years of experience in the IT and software industries, working across a variety of organisation types, sizes, and sectors from tiny ISPs and consulting businesses to telecomms, finance, and academia. Initially a systems administrator with some coding ability, over the years I've transitioned into leadership roles.

Honesty, integrity, and maintaing an inclusive culture are very important to me.

## What I'm looking for

Not actively seeking a new role right now, but open to opportunties for my next career move. This might include things like:

- a more senior role in a larger infrastructure team, e.g., head of infra
- a more senior role in a smaller engineering team, e.g., head of engineering
- perhaps a similar role but in a more general software engineering team
- or if you've got the dollarydoos and want to build a kick-ass accessibility testing toolkit, I'd absolutely be up for that

## Skills

- Team leadership and building
- Strong written and verbal communications, including explaining technical concepts and tradeoffs to folks with other backgrounds and negotiating with stakeholders and suppliers
- Business case development
- Programming: primarily back-end in Python and Perl, with some Ruby on Rails and PHP. Basic Javascript. HTML and CSS.
- Database design and implementation: mainly with MySQL and derivatives of late, but also Sybase and some PostgreSQL. Experience as a DBA.
- Web accessibility, testing and remediation
- Infrastructure architecture design, implementation, and maintenance
- Certified SCRUM Master
